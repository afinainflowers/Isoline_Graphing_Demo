How to use:
Click "Fil–¥ Sample Data" for a nice example or "Generate data" for a random one.
Then click "Draw Isolines".

Steps of the algorithm:
1. Divide the field into regions, by Delanuay triangulation
2. Make a grid with a preset step and linearly approximmate heights by the corners of the vertex regions.
3. Use Marching Squares to draw isolines.
